The session began with the group wrapping up their conversation with **Baron Von Strik** at the college. While most of the party decided to head to **The Copper Cup** to relax, **Nekis Bigbluff** and **Vaelan Emberstone** lingered behind. Nekis, true to his mischievous nature, attempted to stick a "kick me" sign on the unsuspecting Baron, only to fail and promptly lose his way in the labyrinthine halls of the college.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group settled into the warm atmosphere of **The Copper Cup**, enjoying hearty stew from the tavern’s famed **Never-Ending Copper Bowl** and a round of drinks. When Nekis and Vaelan eventually joined the group, they concocted a scheme to charm the tavern keeper into giving them a free bottle of rum. After their persuasive attempts fell flat, the trio of Nekis, Vaelan, and **Ferin Blackfang** resorted to a daring (and somewhat clumsy) theft, making off with the rum and fleeing into the night. Later, Nekis—drunk on both rum and mischief—returned to the tavern in disguise to perform on the **Copper Stage**, earning a rain of copper coins from the amused crowd, including **Thorne**.

Flush with his minor success, Nekis staggered off toward the docks, intent on exploring the city further. However, his intoxicated state and unfamiliarity with Ardenfall's streets led him astray. Before long, members of **The House of Varnoss** ambushed him and dragged him away to their lair.

Nekis awoke in a dimly lit, cobblestone chamber, bound to a chair. Waiting for him was **Nadia Varnoss**, the infamous enforcer of the Varnoss family. Accusing Nekis of cheating at their casino and murdering one of their operatives who had been tailing him, Nadia interrogated him ruthlessly. Nekis, genuinely unaware of any wrongdoing, could offer no answers. Frustrated by his lack of cooperation, Nadia escalated her torture, only to discover Nekis had an unsettling enjoyment of her methods. Disgusted and enraged, she decided to take drastic action, severing his manhood as punishment.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party awoke to realize Nekis was missing. Suspecting the involvement of the Varnoss family, they headed to the docks to gather information. After questioning a dockworker, they learned of a prisoner being taken to a nearby warehouse. Acting swiftly, the group devised a distraction to slip past the guards and infiltrate the building.

Navigating through the warehouse, they found a basement guarded by Varnoss enforcers. A tense battle ensued, with the party overcoming the guards and locating Nekis in the nick of time. They managed to rescue their eccentric bard and, using some quick thinking and magical assistance, reattached his mutilated anatomy. However, before reviving Nekis, the group decided to leave him a "surprise" as a playful payback for his antics.

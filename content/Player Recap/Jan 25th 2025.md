### **Session Recap**

After accepting the quest from **Baron Von Strik**, the group set out under the cover of night toward the southwest forest in search of the rumored cave. With **Ferin Blackfang’s** tracking expertise, they located the entrance to **Shadowspire Hollow**, a foreboding cave covered in pulsing, decayed moss and glowing green rocks.

Inside, they quickly discovered the cave's dangers: the moss released poisonous gas, and the glowing rocks exploded on contact. **Nekis**, ignoring the warnings, triggered several explosions before **Aine** stepped in. However, **Ferin** decided to test the rocks further, setting off another explosion with ball bearings. The commotion woke three **giant bats**, their bodies coursing with the same green corruption. The group dealt with them swiftly and pressed on.

In the next chamber, they found what once might have been a dining hall, now overtaken by the same moss and plant life. Scratched into the walls were maddened messages like _“The power grows stronger. It will consume us all.”_ Reanimated skeletons attacked, but the group handled them with precision, moving deeper into the cave.

Finally, they reached the source of the corruption. A glowing green orb wrapped in vines pulsed ominously atop a pedestal. A man stood before it, laughing maniacally. **Nekis**, true to form, attempted to pickpocket the man, only to fail and spark a chaotic fight. In the melee, Nekis tried to pull the orb from the pedestal, only to be violently thrown back. Upon recovering, he gazed into the orb and was overwhelmed with paranoia as whispers filled his mind. He also saw a vision of a man on a hill, watching adventurers destroy a similar green stone.

Meanwhile, the group defeated the **corrupted leader**, who left them with a chilling final warning: _“He will consume you all.”_

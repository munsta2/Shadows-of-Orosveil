### Session Recap: The Journey Begins

The adventurers' journey began at **The Compass Keep**, the heart of **The Silver Circle**, where they arrived at the guild’s barracks and were greeted by the steadfast **Captain Lyris Oakhelm**. Lyris welcomed the group and introduced them to the basics of guild life, setting the tone for their first day as initiates.

From there, the party met the enigmatic **Guildmaster Thalric Ironspire** in the guild's Great Hall. Thalric presented each adventurer with their Silver Circle brooch—a symbol of their membership—and entrusted them with their very first assignment: to investigate reports of unusual disturbances in the forest near the village of **Thornshade**.

On their journey to Thornshade, the party encountered a procession from the **Church of the Everlight**: priests escorted by **Knights of the Everlight** on official Church business. While the Church members remained distant and tight-lipped, their presence left an impression of the powerful and secretive role the Everlight plays in Orosveil. After a brief interaction, both groups continued on their separate paths.

Arriving in the quiet village of **Thornshade**, the adventurers sought out **Elder Rowan**, the village elder. He directed them to **Maric Frostwind**, a seasoned hunter who had been keeping an eye on the strange occurrences. Maric guided the group into the forest, where they discovered the source of the disturbances: a pulsating blue-green stone etched with strange runes. Its magic had corrupted the local wildlife, including a pack of wolves glowing with the same eerie light.

After a fierce battle, the party defeated the wolves and destroyed the stone, ending its corruptive influence. However, as the magical energy dissipated, a hooded figure was seen watching them from a distance. Before the group could investigate, the figure vanished into the shadows.

With the mystery unresolved, the adventurers caught a ride back to The Compass Keep with a passing merchant. Upon reporting their findings to **Guildmaster Thalric**, the group was formally inducted into the guild as **rookies**, marking their first step in the ranks of **The Silver Circle**.

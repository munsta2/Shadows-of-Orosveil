### **Session Recap**

The adventurers began their journey at **The Compass Keep**, where Guildmaster **Thalric Ironspire** presented them with two assignments. After some discussion, they decided to help a merchant recover his stolen goods from a group of raiders who had ambushed his wagon near the forest.

Following a brief negotiation with the merchant, the party headed to the ambush site to investigate. Using their tracking skills, they followed the trail to a cave deep in the wilderness. Along the way, they were attacked by a group of scouts, likely from the raiders, but the party managed to fend them off without major trouble.

As they approached the cave entrance, one of the party members accidentally triggered an alarm system, alerting the raiders inside. The party was forced into a battle against six enemies, a mix of kobolds and goblins, but emerged victorious after a hard-fought skirmish. Taking a moment to recover, they rested and prepared to delve deeper into the cave.

At the heart of the cave, they overheard an argument between the leaders of the raiders—a goblin and a kobold—squabbling over their stolen loot. Using a mix of creativity and guile, one party member distracted the leaders with a bizarre performance involving music and painting with blood. Taking advantage of the chaos, the group stealthily approached and swiftly dealt with the two bosses, securing the merchant's stolen chest and claiming additional loot for themselves.

On their journey back to the Keep, the group stumbled upon the body of a priest from the **Church of the Everlight**. Searching the scene, they discovered a coded message hidden in the priest’s belongings. After some effort, they successfully decoded the cryptic warning: 

*"Beware the Everlight’s shadow. The dragon stirs, and their flame seeks to consume the throne. Trust no heralds of the Dawn; they carry only ruin.""*

Returning to **The Compass Keep**, the adventurers handed over the recovered chest to the merchant. However, with some clever deception, they convinced him that one of their own had perished in the quest, persuading him to pay extra to cover the "funeral expenses."

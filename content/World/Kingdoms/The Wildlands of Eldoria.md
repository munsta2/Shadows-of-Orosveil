- **Capital**: **Eldergrove**
- **Geography**: Deep within the northern forests, Eldoria is largely covered in vast woodlands and rivers. Its remote location makes it more mysterious and disconnected from the other kingdoms.
- **Culture**: **Eldoria** is a **mystical kingdom**, known for its deep connection to nature and ancient druidic traditions. The people of Eldoria, called the **Wildborn**, live in harmony with the natural world, and their rulers are often **druids** or **nature-priests**. The kingdom is a place of ancient magic, where outsiders are rare and viewed with suspicion.
- **Ruler**: **High Druid Caelia Moonleaf** â€“ A wise and enigmatic leader, she is said to communicate directly with the spirits of the forest. She leads with a light hand, allowing the people of Eldoria to live freely, guided by the natural rhythms of the land.

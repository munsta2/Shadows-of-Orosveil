The **Everlight** is the central divine figure in the Church of the Everlight’s theology, revered as the ultimate source of all creation, light, and order in the universe. Described as a being of pure, radiant energy, the Everlight is often depicted as a **vast celestial entity**, whose form transcends the mortal understanding of gender, race, or shape. To its followers, the Everlight represents purity, justice, and the eternal force of good that opposes the encroaching darkness of chaos and corruption.

-  The Everlight is often described as a **luminous figure**, cloaked in shimmering, golden light. In sacred texts and visions, it appears as a radiant, ethereal form, too bright for any mortal eyes to fully behold. Its presence is said to be blinding, yet also warm and comforting, like the sun’s light on a spring morning.

The **Church of the Everlight** is the dominant religious institution across much of Orosveil. It plays a central role in both spiritual life and political affairs, especially through its long-standing support of the Albrador Dynasty. The Church teaches that its faith is the guiding light of the world, offering salvation, order, and divine purpose to its followers. Its influence is widespread, touching every aspect of society—from the governance of kingdoms to the daily lives of the common folk.

### **Founding and Beliefs**

#### **Origin of the Faith**

- The Church of the Everlight traces its origins to the **First Prophet, [[Soltheos]]**, a visionary who claimed to have received divine revelations from the [[Everlight]], a celestial being of pure light and creation. Soltheos is said to have wandered the lands of Orosveil, preaching about a coming age of unity, peace, and divine purpose under the Everlight's guidance.
- According to legend, the Everlight is the primordial source of all goodness and order in the universe, bringing warmth and hope to a world once engulfed by darkness and chaos. It is believed that the Everlight created the world to be a reflection of its divine light, and that mortals are its chosen stewards, destined to spread its influence and protect creation.

#### **Core Tenets**

- **Divine Order**: The Everlight's will is to bring order to the world, and all things must adhere to their proper place in this divine hierarchy. The Church promotes the idea that societal structures—such as the monarchy, noble houses, and the clergy—are divinely ordained.
- **The Light of Purity**: Followers of the Everlight believe in the purification of the soul, casting off darkness and evil through acts of virtue, faith, and devotion. Darkness, in the form of corruption, malevolent magic, and chaos, is seen as the Everlight’s ancient enemy.
- **Salvation Through Unity**: The Everlight teaches that unity among the people and kingdoms of Orosveil is crucial for peace and prosperity. War and division are often framed as struggles against the Everlight’s vision of harmony.
- **Eternal Vigilance**: The Church warns of a cosmic battle between the Everlight and the forces of shadow, known as the **Veil of Night**, which seeks to undo the Everlight’s creation. Followers are taught to be ever vigilant against the creeping influence of darkness—whether through war, dark magic, or moral corruption.

### **Structure and Hierarchy**

####  **The High Radiant (Spiritual Leader)**

- The head of the Church is the **High Radiant**, who is considered the living voice of the Everlight on Orosveil. This figure is chosen through a council of the highest-ranking clerics and is believed to be guided by divine inspiration.
- The High Radiant resides in **The Grand Cathedral of Luminor**, a towering religious and political center. The cathedral is a marvel of white stone, adorned with golden icons of the Everlight and stained-glass windows that tell the story of creation and the faith’s rise.


#### **The Luminars (Priests and Clergy)**

- The **Luminars** are the priests and clergy who serve the day-to-day spiritual needs of the people. They lead services, offer blessings, and provide counsel in matters of faith. Luminars are known for their healing magic and ability to perform divine rites, such as weddings, funerals, and rituals of purification.
- **Battle Luminars** also exist—clergy members trained to fight in holy wars or defend sacred places, wielding both weapons and divine magic in the Everlight’s name.

####  **The Templars of Everlight**

- The Church maintains a highly esteemed knightly order known as the **Templars of the Everlight**, elite warriors who serve both as protectors of the faith and enforcers of its will. These templars are often deployed to defend the Church’s interests, protect relics, and fight against threats deemed to be manifestations of the Veil of Night.

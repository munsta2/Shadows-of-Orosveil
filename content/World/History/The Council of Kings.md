he **Council of Kings** in Orosveil is a powerful political body composed of the rulers of Valtheron's major kingdoms. It was established centuries ago as a way to manage the delicate balance of power between the often-warring states and to prevent any one kingdom from gaining too much influence. The Council is both a forum for diplomacy and a battlefield for political intrigue, where alliances are made, broken, and reshaped as the ever-shifting tides of power flow through the continent.

### **Structure and Function**

1. **Membership**:
    
    - The Council is made up of the monarchs or ruling representatives of each of the major kingdoms in Valtheron. Each member has equal standing, regardless of the size or power of their realm, though some rulers hold more sway through influence, wealth, or military strength.
    - In times of war or conflict, temporary seats may be given to military leaders or envoys from other nations if their interests align with the council’s decisions.
2. **Meetings**:
    
    - The Council meets in a **neutral, fortified city**, often referred to as the **Sanctuary of Kings**, which is centrally located between the kingdoms. This city is considered sacred ground, and no army may march upon it under threat of the Church of the Everlight’s wrath.
    - Meetings are called at regular intervals or during times of crisis, with a special messenger network ensuring that each kingdom is informed. The meetings are often highly secretive, with only the most trusted advisors allowed to attend.
3. **Purpose**:
    
    - The Council’s primary purpose is to **maintain peace and mediate disputes** between kingdoms. When wars are inevitable, the Council tries to negotiate terms to prevent mass destruction, focusing on more limited, contained conflicts.
    - They also discuss trade routes, diplomatic treaties, and alliances, along with important decisions about managing Valtheron’s borders, particularly in times of threat from external forces or rebellions.
    - The Council also holds considerable **religious authority** due to the deep connection between the kingdoms and the Church of the Everlight. Often, their decisions are backed by religious endorsement, further solidifying their influence.

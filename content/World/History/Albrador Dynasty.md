The **Albrador Dynasty** is one of the most ancient and powerful ruling families in Orosveil, tracing its origins back to the early days of the continentâ€™s unification. Known for its longevity, ambition, and deep ties to magic and tradition, the Albrador Dynasty has ruled over vast territories for centuries, weathering countless wars, political shifts, and internal rivalries.

The Dynasty lasted over 300 years.

The world has almost all forgotten about the Albrador Dynasty in due part to the [[The War of the Hundred Crowns]] destroying most of the once great family.

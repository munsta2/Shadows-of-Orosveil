### **The Gilded Court (Casino District)**

owned by  [[The House of Varnoss]]

Ardenfall’s casino district, **The Gilded Court**, is a dazzling array of high-stakes gambling halls, luxury lounges, and exclusive clubs, catering to the city’s wealthiest citizens and adventurous gamblers. It is a place of opulence and excess, where fortunes are made and lost overnight.

#### **Key Attractions in The Gilded Court**:

- **The Silver Coin Casino**: The largest and most extravagant casino in Ardenfall, featuring grand chandeliers, velvet-clad tables, and games like dice, cards, and roulette. A fountain in the center sprays enchanted water that glimmers like liquid silver.
    
    - _Special Feature_: A high-roller room called “The Vault,” accessible only to those with invitations or a substantial buy-in. Rumored to host games where artifacts, secrets, and deeds to lands are wagered.
    - _Possible Hooks_: The players might overhear whispers about illicit dealings, or they could spot an NPC losing something valuable to a mysterious figure.
- **The Golden Chalice**: An upscale bar and lounge offering exotic drinks, live music, and private meeting spaces. Its balcony overlooks the bustling bazaar.
    
    - _Special Drink_: “The Emberlight Elixir,” a fiery cocktail said to enhance one’s luck (purely decorative, or maybe not...).
- **The Crimson Card**: A slightly less prestigious establishment known for its rowdy atmosphere and low-stakes gambling. Popular with adventurers and mercenaries looking for a good time.
    

#### **Security and Mysteries**:

- The Gilded Court is heavily patrolled by private guards, hired directly by the casino owners, and elite enforcers from the **Mercian League**.
- Rumors of rigged games and underground tournaments circulate, though no evidence has ever been found.

### **How to Play**

1. **Place Bets**:
    - Players place their wagers before cards are dealt.
2. **Deal Cards**:
    - Each player is dealt two cards face-up.
    - The dealer gets two cards: one face-up and one face-down (the “hole card”).
3. **Player Turns**:
    - Players take turns deciding how to play their hands. They have the following options:
        - **Hit**: Take another card to increase the hand’s value.
        - **Stand**: Keep the current hand and end their turn.
        - **Double Down**: Double the bet and take only one additional card.
        - **Split**: If dealt two cards of the same value, split them into two separate hands (requires an additional bet equal to the original).
        - **Surrender**: Forfeit half the bet and end the turn (if the casino allows it).
4. **Dealer’s Turn**:
    - After all players finish their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card.
    - The dealer must hit if their hand is under 17 and stand if it’s 17 or higher.
5. **Winning**:
    - A hand closer to 21 than the dealer’s wins.
    - If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), all remaining players win.
    - If the player busts, they lose their bet.

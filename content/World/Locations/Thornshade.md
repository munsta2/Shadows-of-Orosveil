Small village due east of [[Skyhelm]]


**The Whispering Pines Inn**:

- **Description**: A cozy, timber-framed inn that serves as the social hub of Thornshade. Its walls are adorned with trophies of hunts and carved wooden motifs of animals and trees.
- **Purpose**: Provides a place for adventurers and travelers to gather information, rest, and hear local gossip.
- **Notable Features**: A carved mural behind the bar depicts a mythical stag said to protect the forest. There’s also a bulletin board with local notices, job postings, and rumors.

**Elder’s Hall**:

- **Purpose**: Acts as the administrative heart of Thornshade, where decisions about trade, security, and disputes are made.
- **Notable Features**: A large oak table surrounded by chairs carved by local artisans. A ceremonial staff, rumored to be blessed by a forest druid, stands in the corner.

**The Hunter’s Lodge**:

- **Description**: A rugged building with walls adorned by pelts and mounted animal heads. It serves as a base for Thornshade’s skilled hunters and trappers.
- **Purpose**: Offers supplies for adventurers venturing into the woods, including basic weapons, traps, and potions.
- **Notable Features**: A map of the forest detailing known trails and dangerous areas, updated regularly by the hunters.
- **Owner**: **Maric Frostwind**, a grizzled human hunter with a sharp eye and a sharper tongue. He’s one of the few who dares venture deep into the forest, and his knowledge of the disturbances makes him a valuable ally—or a reluctant informant.

**The Old Shrine**:

- **Description**: A weathered stone shrine on the outskirts of the village, dedicated to **Sylvara**, a local nature deity associated with the balance of the forest.
- **Purpose**: A place of worship and reflection for villagers seeking blessings for hunts or protection from the forest.
- **Notable Features**: Overgrown vines intertwine with the stonework, and offerings of flowers, carved wood, and small trinkets are left at its base.
- **Caretaker**: **Lyra Faeborne**, a half-elf druid who tends to the shrine and serves as a spiritual guide. She is deeply concerned about the recent magical disturbances and is willing to aid those who seek to restore balance.

**The Glimmering Brook**:

- **Description**: A crystal-clear stream running through the village, its waters fed by the forest springs. Locals claim the brook has minor restorative properties.
- **Purpose**: A gathering spot for villagers, particularly children and washerwomen, and a source of clean water.

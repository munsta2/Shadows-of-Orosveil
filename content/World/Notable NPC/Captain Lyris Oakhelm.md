## Background
---
Captain Lyris Oakhelm was marked by the Everlight from birth, granting her the qualities of an Aasimar. This divine connection set her apart, making her a figure of reverence and expectation. Born to a family of merchant-adventurers, she was exposed early to tales of valor and exploration, nurturing her ambitions beyond the ordinary path of her lineage. She joined The Silver Circle in her late teens, driven by a calling to lead and protect.

Over two decades, she proved herself in critical battles, including the defense of The Compass Keep against mercenaries attempting to challenge the guild’s neutral stance. Her celestial gifts often manifested as brief moments of divine insight or a calming influence in chaotic situations. Despite her connection to the Everlight, Lyris chose not to join the Church, prioritizing the guild’s autonomy.

Her presence is a source of inspiration, blending martial prowess and divine insight. Lyris’s path reflects the balance she maintains between her heritage and her loyalty to the guild, making her both a formidable leader and a guardian of The Silver Circle’s principles.

# Faction Overview
Making a change to test
**Faction Type**: Mercenary and Bounty Hunter Guild  
**Reputation**: Ruthless, efficient, and morally flexible
### **Origins and Organization**

The Red Banner began as a loosely organized band of warriors, outcasts, and former soldiers united under a common goal: profit above all else. Over time, they evolved into a formidable mercenary group, with an internal code of conduct focused on loyalty to contracts, not causes. This flexibility has allowed them to take on a variety of missions—whether it’s protecting high-profile targets, hunting bounties, or assisting in military campaigns.

Their name, “Red Banner,” symbolizes both their willingness to shed blood and the high price of their services. For the right sum, they take on nearly any mission, leaving ethics and allegiance aside. They operate from various strongholds and hidden outposts across the continents, allowing them to mobilize quickly and work discreetly.

### **Philosophy and Code**

The Red Banner’s motto, “Loyal to Coin, Bound to None,” captures their mercenary spirit. Their unofficial code emphasizes loyalty to contracts above all else, regardless of the moral or political implications.

1. **Contracts are Binding**: Once taken, a contract is completed. The Red Banner does not break deals—failure to complete a mission results in severe punishment.
2. **No Questions Asked**: The Red Banner doesn’t pry into a client’s motives, so long as the coin is paid.
3. **Strength Above All**: Weakness is unacceptable. Members are expected to be strong, efficient, and willing to put their lives on the line.

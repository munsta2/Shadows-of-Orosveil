They are not just soldiers but a legendary order, revered for their discipline, resilience, and unshakable loyalty to the kingdom

### **Background and Origins**

The **Stoneguard Warriors** trace their origins to the founding of the **Elorith Dominion**. When the northern clans first unified under the Elorith banner, they faced constant threats from both external invaders and the harsh, unforgiving environment of the mountain ranges. To survive, they forged a warrior tradition that prioritized endurance, fortification, and mastery of their terrain. Over generations, the Stoneguard became the backbone of the kingdom’s military and a symbol of its impenetrable strength.

The **Order of the Stoneguard** was officially established when Queen Isolde Elorith’s ancestor, **King Borin Elorith**, formed the Stoneguard to defend the kingdom from a powerful invasion force that sought to conquer the mountains. Under his leadership, the Stoneguard fortified key mountain passes and repelled the invaders with cunning tactics and unmatched defensive capabilities.

In the **Elorith Dominion**, the Stoneguard are not just soldiers but revered heroes, seen as the protectors of the kingdom. Many Stoneguard Warriors come from noble families, and it is considered a great honor to serve in their ranks. Their loyalty to the ruling **Elorith family** is absolute, and they are often deployed to guard key members of the royal family or high-ranking officials.

Many kingdoms have tried and failed to conquer Elorith, largely because of the Stoneguard’s ability to defend the kingdom’s mountainous borders.

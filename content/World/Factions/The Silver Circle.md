## <u>Overview</u>

**The Silver Circle** is a renowned adventurers' guild known for its unwavering neutrality and dedication to the common good. Founded in an age of constant turmoil, the guild rose as a rare impartial force, offering its services to anyone in need, be they noble or commoner, merchant or soldier. Bound by a code of ethics, the Silver Circle chooses its missions carefully, prioritizing protection, exploration, and the preservation of knowledge over the pursuit of power or wealth.

With a strict policy of neutrality, the Silver Circle maintains its independence by reserving the right to refuse any request. Kingdoms and factions often approach the guild for aid, but the Circle’s leaders refuse missions that could fuel conflict, disrupt political stability, or favor one side of a power struggle. This unbiased approach has earned the Silver Circle respect across Orosveil, as well as occasional friction with those who would prefer a more malleable ally.

The guild’s headquarters located in the city Skyhelm, bustling with adventurers from all walks of life, serves as a hub for those seeking to test their mettle, uncover the world’s mysteries, or simply make a name for themselves without political entanglement. To adventurers, the Silver Circle is not just an organization; it’s a sanctuary, a network, and a purpose-driven family with a shared commitment to integrity and honor.

## <u>Home Brew Rules</u>

as the campaign goes I will be introducing some Home Brew rules to the campaign. These rules will mostly be in place to help make the campaign run smoother or put some stuff in place for when the base rule set is unclear

### <u>Rule 1</u>

Health potions will now have 2 ways to use it.

example for a basic health potion

bonus action:  roll 2d4 + 2 hit points when you consume it.

Full action: gain the full 2d4 + 2 health but it takes your whole turn

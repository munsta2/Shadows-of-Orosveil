For this campaign I would like you as the players to put more time and thought into your characters. A character in DnD is more then just a collection of stats on a sheet but rather living breathing thing. So coming up with some basic backstory and motivations are great ways to make them come alive!

If you want your characters backstory to tie in more with the world Orosveil feel free to read the some of the lore of the world that I have provided. Don't hesitate to ask me any question or if you want to run some character ideas off of me.

After you create the basic character template (race, class, stats, etc.) I want you to answer these six questions. Spend as much time as you feel necessary to flesh out your character!

Something to keep in mind while creating your characters is the way I'm starting off the campaign is that all of you will be new initiates to [[The Silver Circle]] an adventuring guild based on the continent of [[Valtheron]]. 

**Step 1: Write 5 background and concept elements that you feel are important to your image of the character. These can be a concept overview, a list of important life events, a physical description, a personality profile...whatever you need to get an image in your mind. 5 is just a minimum...more elements are encouraged!**

**Step 2: List at least two goals for the character. At least one of these goals should be one that the character has, while another should be one that you, as a player, want to see developed over the course of the game.**

**Step 3: List at least two secrets about your character. One is a secret the character knows, one is a secret that involves him but that he is not actually aware of yet. This will help me in creating plots that centre around your character. I will also be creating a third secret which you as a player will not be aware of, so expect some surprises!**

**Step 4: Describe at least three people that are tied to the character. Two of them are friendly to the character, one is hostile. If you like, you can include an enemy of yours here as well, so I have an instant NPC nemesis to throw at you.**

**Step 5: Describe three memories, mannerisms, or quirks that your character has. They don't have to be elaborate, but they should provide some context and flavour.**

**Step 6: Why has your character decided to join the silver circle?**

When your character is fully complete if you could please send me these 6 questions along with your backstory and character name that would be great!

## <u>Character creation guide</u>

The players handbook does a very good of guiding you through the process to create a character but if you want a more in depth guide there's a ton of videos of YouTube describing how to fill out the character sheet

For deciding abilities scores were going to use a point buy system:

**Point Buy System Guide**
- **Starting Points**: You have **27 points** to distribute.
- **Starting Score**: Each ability starts at **8**. You cannot lower a score below 8 or raise it above 15 with points alone.
- **Point Costs**:
    - **8**: Free
    - **9**: 1 point
    - **10**: 2 points
    - **11**: 3 points
    - **12**: 4 points
    - **13**: 5 points
    - **14**: 7 points
    - **15**: 9 points
- **Apply Racial Bonuses**: After assigning points, add any racial bonuses to your scores (these can raise a score above 15).
if you have any question on how the point buy system works reach out to me! also the PHB describes this in more detail
## <u>Character tracking options</u>

1. Pen and Paper - if you prefer classic pen and paper option here is the regular character sheet in which you can download [character sheet](https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/rpg.rem.uz/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/D%26D%205th%20Edition/Character%20Sheets/Character%20Sheet%20%28Official%29.pdf) The form is pdf fillable however the font is big so I still recommend you print it out if want to go this option. 

2.  Using a tablet with the above character sheet - This is the option i probably recommend to anyone with a tablet and some form of stylus. Makes it a whole lot easier to keep track of your character this way

4. DnD Beyond - [dnd beyond character builder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder) This is a good tool just make sure your picking options from the 2014 rule set

## <u>DnD 2014 Rule Set</u>

**Welcome to the world of Orosveil!** As we begin our journey, please note that we’ll be using the _2014 edition of the Player’s Handbook_. When looking up character options, spells, or rules online, please make sure the resources you’re checking specify they’re for this version. This will help keep everything consistent and aligned as we explore the world together.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions. Looking forward to seeing the characters and stories you bring to life!

For the more advance players who have looked at the 2024 edition of the rule book and want to include something from it into the campaign talk to me and we can work something out. As of right now I prefer to stick to 5e 2014 since it's what I'm most familiar with and it has the most resources online for it.

For the ones using DnD beyond to create their character please be careful not to choose any content from the newer players hand book since they have integrated both rule sets into the platform.

Example:

The red would be the new 2024 rules where as the blue is the old 2014 rules.

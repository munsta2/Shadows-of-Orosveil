## <u>DnD 2014 Rule Set</u>

**Welcome to the world of Orosveil!** As we begin our journey, please note that we’ll be using the _2014 edition of the Player’s Handbook_. When looking up character options, spells, or rules online, please make sure the resources you’re checking specify they’re for this version. This will help keep everything consistent and aligned as we explore the world together.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions. Looking forward to seeing the characters and stories you bring to life!

For the more advance players who have looked at the 2024 edition of the rule book and want to include something from it into the campaign talk to me and we can work something out. As of right now I prefer to stick to 5e 2014 since it's what I'm most familiar with and it has the most resources online for it.

For the ones using DnD beyond to create their character please be careful not to choose any content from the newer players hand book since they have integrated both rule sets into the platform.

Example:

The red would be the new 2024 rules where as the blue is the old 2014 rules.

## <u> Note taking </u>

I highly recommend players take some form of notes throughout the campaign. 

Since we're playing bi weekly there's a good chance you might forget some details that might be important down the road.

When I play as a player here's stuff I like to take notes on:

- any important characters I meet and what purpose do they serve in regards to my player
- Any quests that I might want to try and complete
- Any details I noticed that I think would be good to know for later 
- questions that I have that I want to try to get answered 


## <u>Learning your character </u> 

After you finishing creating your character (for more info look to the [[Creating Your Character for Shadows of Orosveil]] guide ) I highly recommend to take some time to learn your characters skills and abilities that come from your class

This means learning the type of spells/ attacks of other things your character might be able to do.

Since we're going to be a bigger group combat is going to take longer. One way we can help speed it up is by knowing how your character works so your not spending time during your turn wondering what you should do
